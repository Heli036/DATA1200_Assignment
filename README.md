# Project Title

**Drug Classification Using SVM and Naive Bayes**

---

## Description

This project implements and evaluates Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes models for drug classification based on patient data. It provides insights into how these algorithms perform in terms of precision, recall, and F1 score. The dataset contains information about patient attributes such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and drug prescriptions. 

The project includes Python code for preprocessing, training, testing, and evaluating the models, with a focus on enabling easy reproducibility.
